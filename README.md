This repository now focuses on a single Tkinter example.

## theatre_gui.py

`theatre_gui.py` displays a movie theatre background with an Exit button. Launch it with:

```bash
python theatre_gui.py
```

The script expects `images/movie_theatre.png` to be present and requires a graphical environment.

## Requirements
