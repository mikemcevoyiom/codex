This repository contains a small PyQt application for selecting audio and
subtitle streams in video files and optionally converting the video stream to
HEVC using FFmpeg. PyQt allows more customizable widgets, including styled
buttons.

After launching the script, choose a folder containing your videos. Two buttons
are available and each operation will be applied to every video in the selected
folder:

* **Convert to HEVC** – converts the currently selected file to HEVC if it is not
  already encoded in HEVC or AV1.
* **Update Streams** – remuxes the chosen audio and subtitle streams while
  keeping the video stream as is.
